Hi, I'm Rey.

Currently an undergraduate at Rutgers University (The Honors College) pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, B.A. in Cognitive Science, and minor in Mathematics, graduating in May 2026.

I am interested in closing the gap between AI capabilties and their usefulness in the real-world. What's the point of impressive benchmark performance if these models aren't actually helping people? My work focuses on human-AI interaction, and mainly involves designing LLM-based systems that target specific user niches.

### Present

I currently lead technical initiatives to automate and enhance clinical training at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS). Here are some quick overviews of what I've been working on:

*   **Virtual Patient Simulation:** real-time, voice-to-voice patient simulation tools using WebRTC and LLMs to help medical students practice history-taking and diagnosis.
*   **Automated Clinical Evaluation:** model and rubric agnostic auto-evaluation system for clinical notes, with validated performance through custom benchmarking.
*   **AI-based Educational Platform:** unification of previous two into online platform where faculty at medical schools can create new custom practice opportunities for their students and track their performance.

### Future

I have seen firsthand through my work at RWJMS that exceptional model capabilities don't automatically translate into helpful tools for real people. Starting fall 2026, I plan to pursue an AI-related master's degree to further build my expertise while also researching the following open problems I have encountered:

*   **Human-Agent Collaboration:** better human-in-the-loop workflows, where agents request for intervention at the correct times.
*   **User-Centric Interpretability:** building true user trust through AI that authentically communicate reasoning traces to non-technical users.
*   **System Evaluation:** scalable frameworks to accurately predict capabilies and failure cases of AI systems (move away from traditional manually annotated benchmarks).

### Advisors

My research is made possible through the mentorship of:

*   **Dr. Siobhan Corbett** (Associate Professor of Surgery, RWJMS)
*   **Dr. Sarang Kim** (Chief of Division of Education, RWJMS)
*   **Rick Anderson** (Director of Emerging Technologies, Rutgers)
*   **Dr. Naveena Yanamala** (Chief of Clinical Research and AI Innovation, RWJMS)
