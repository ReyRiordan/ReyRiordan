Hi, I'm Rey.

Currently an undergraduate at Rutgers University (The Honors College) pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, B.A. in Cognitive Science, and minor in Mathematics, graduating in May 2026.

I am interested in closing the gap between AI capabilties and their usefulness in the real-world. What's the point of impressive benchmark performance if these models aren't actually helping people?

Over the past two years, I have been leading several AI initiatives at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS). Some highlights are: 
- Virtual patient simulation
- Automated clinical note evaluation
- AI-based medical education platform

Starting fall 2026, I plan to pursue an AI-related master's degree to further build my expertise while also researching:
- Human-agent collaboration
- User-centric interpreability
- Novel system evaluation frameworks
