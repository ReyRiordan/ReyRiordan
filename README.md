Currently an undergraduate at the Honors College of Rutgers University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, B.A. in Cognitive Science, and minor in Mathematics, graduating in May 2026.

I am working to close the gap between AI capabilities and their real-world usefulness.

### 🏥 Research
Over the past two years, I have been leading several AI-for-education initiatives at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS). Some highlights are: 
*   Virtual patient simulation
*   Automated clinical note evaluation
*   AI-based medical education platform

### 🎓 Future
Starting fall 2026, I plan to pursue an AI-related master's degree to further build my expertise while also researching:
*   Human-agent collaboration
*   User-centric interpretability
*   Robust & scalable system evaluation
