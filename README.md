Hi, I'm Rey.

Currently an undergraduate at Rutgers University (The Honors College) pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, B.A. in Cognitive Science, and minor in Mathematics, graduating in May 2026.

I am interested in closing the gap between AI capabilties and their usefulness in the real-world. What's the point of impressive benchmark performance if these models aren't actually helping people?

### Present

Over the past two years, I have been leading several AI initiatives at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS):

*   **Virtual Patient Simulation:** real-time, voice-to-voice patient simulation tools using WebRTC and LLMs to help medical students practice history-taking and diagnosis.
*   **Automated Clinical Evaluation:** model and rubric agnostic auto-evaluation system for clinical notes, with validated performance through custom benchmarking.
*   **AI-based Educational Platform:** unification of previous two into online platform where faculty at medical schools can create new custom practice opportunities for their students and track their performance.

### Future

Starting fall 2026, I plan to pursue an AI-related master's degree to further build my expertise while also researching the following open problems I have encountered:

*   **Human-Agent Collaboration:** better human-in-the-loop workflows, where agents request for intervention at the correct times.
*   **User-Centric Interpretability:** building true user trust through AI that authentically communicate reasoning traces to non-technical users.
*   **System Evaluation:** scalable frameworks to accurately predict capabilies and failure cases of AI systems (move away from traditional manually annotated benchmarks).

### Advisors

My work is made possible through the mentorship of:

*   [**Dr. Siobhan Corbett**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveena-yanamala-ms-phd-fase-240a229/) (Associate Professor of Surgery, RWJMS)
*   [**Dr. Sarang Kim**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarang-kim-842054105/) (Chief of Division of Education, RWJMS)
*   [**Rick Anderson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-anderson-4930741/) (Director of Emerging Technologies, Rutgers)
